a. Automated testing drastically reduces the repeated work in ensuring a quality deployment by automating all of the testing. This leaves the varied and specific features and scenarios that need tested to the computer rather than any of the programmers. This is much better, as programmers could easily forget steps or incorrectly set them up, and they can spend more time doing things other than testing. The tests ensure that any changes are proper and functional, so that the deployed application doesn't break in some way.
b. GitHub told me where the problem is, showing the steps of execution and granting the error codes that would show in the console when running things locally. This allows the problem to be diagnosed easily and resolved without hunting for what could be a single character in a large codebase.
c. GitHub Actions is excellent and works out of the box for many applications. It is simpler, much easier to use, and runs on the cloud. Jenkins is far more customizable and runs locally. This customization comes with an extreme degree of compatibility in the right hands, but is much harder to use than GitHub Actions.
d. The automation of tests might run similarly for larger projects, but with greater importance as many changes are happening at once. Tests would be written for new features, and existing features would probably also have their tests updated as more is added to them. There might be some sort of protocol to follow when writing test cases as well.
